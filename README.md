Hi there!

I am frag. 

I work with math and computers.

I write mainly in Python and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Not in that order.

I am the host of [Data science at home podcast](https://datascienceathome.com), founder of [Amethix Technologies](https://amethix.com).

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ThisIsFrag) or add me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/fragadaleta)
