# Hi there! 👋

## I am frag. 

## Francesco Gadaleta, that is.

TL;DR; I build AI and Machine Learning solutions in several application domains.

<hr />

I have a MSc in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a PhD. in Computer Science from the University of Leuven (Belgium). 
I work with math and computers since a very (very) young age.
My favourite OSes are *NIX systems, and the programming languages of choice are mainly Python and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), not necessarily in that order.

## Work 👨‍💻 

You may know me from my podcast 🎙️ [Data science at home podcast](https://datascienceathome.com) or from some work 🤖 I have made at [Amethix Technologies](https://amethix.com). 

I design and implement deep tech solutions and highly-critical systems in several sectors (fintech, insurtech, military). Many repositories are not public for licensing restrictions.
