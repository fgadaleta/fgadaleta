Hi there!

I am frag. 

I work with math and computers.

I write mainly in Python and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Not in that order.

I am the host of [Data science at home podcast](https://datascienceathome.com), founder of [Amethix Technologies](https://amethix.com).

I have a weakness for smart people, remote working, hard problems and books.
