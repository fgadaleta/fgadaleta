# Hi there!

## I am frag. 

## Francesco Gadaleta, that is.

TL;DR; I build AI and Machine Learning solutions in several application domains.

<hr />

I've got a MSc in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a PhD. in Computer Science from the University of Leuven (Belgium). 
I work with math and computers since a very (very) young age.
My favourite OS are *NIX systems, and the programming languages of choice are mainly Python and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Not necessarily in that order.

## Work

You may know me from my podcast [Data science at home podcast](https://datascienceathome.com) or from some work I have made at [Amethix Technologies](https://amethix.com). 

I design and implement deep tech solutions in several domains. Many repositories are not public for licensing restrictions.
