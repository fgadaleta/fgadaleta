# Hi there!

## I am frag. 


I work with math and computers.

I write mainly in Python and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Not necessarily in that order.

You may know me from my podcast [Data science at home podcast](https://datascienceathome.com) or from some work I have made with [Amethix Technologies](https://amethix.com).

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ThisIsFrag),  add me on [keybase](https://keybase.io/fragadaleta) or read some personal notes on [codingossip](https://codingossip.github.io)
